With the data available, it is possible to download the corresponding neuroimages from the ADNI database (which cannot
be made available here).

*CDI_dataset_info.csv*: corresponds to a table with information about the dataset used to validate the classification model.

*CDI_AD/CDI_nAD*: corresponds to a folder with pre-processed (normalized, masked and smoothed) neuroimages used to validate the classification model.
(AD: Alzheimer's disease group, nAD: non-Alzheimer's disease group)

*ADNI_AD/ADNI_CN*: corresponds to a folder with pre-processed (normalized, masked and smoothed) neuroimages used to train the classification model.
(AD: Alzheimer's disease group, CN: Cognitively normal group)

*OKmask20.img/.hdr*: this file corresponds to the mask used for pre-processing all the neuroimages used in the project.

*param_tbl.xlsx*: GridSearchCV results for each model and hyperparameter combination.
